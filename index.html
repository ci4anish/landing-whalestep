            We are different from common freelancers teams who are working apart in the way that we work in the same
            office and have 2+ years of experience working together as a team. During that time we established a great
            level of communication and performance which can not be achieved in the short time span. <br><br>

            Also, we are not an agency, which means you don't pay for HR, Management and other unnecessary overheads.
            However, our background of work in various enterprise and startups orientated companies gives us flexibility
            and vision how to integrate to your management infrastructure, or build one from the scratch.

                    The Whale Step team was a pleasure to work with. They were able to jump right into our project and
                    help
                    take the lead of the front end. Taras, the team lead, was great with communication and did proper

                    and our conversation are instrumental, giving an in-depth understanding of companies negotiation

                        Whale Step is a team of bright, driven young developers. They worked well on my product as
                        co-developers to my existing team and showed improvements in their communication with them over
                        the
                        months. They also could be relied upon to use our systems and processes effectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They worked consistently until the project was completed and showed initiative by researching
                        solutions and making suggestions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As it is, for now, they delivered quality code which will soon go live. The whole team wishes
                        Whale
                        Step the best of success and hopefully, we will work together in the future on the next
                        iterations
                        of our product.
