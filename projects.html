                                        They were able to jump right into our project and help take the lead of the
                                        front end.
                                        Taras, the team lead, was great with communication and did proper research on
                                        given tasks.

                                        We would highly recommend Whale Step and will be working with them again on
                                        future projects.

                                        Whale Step is a team of bright, driven young developers. They worked well on my
                                        product as
                                        co-developers to my existing team and showed improvements in their communication
                                        with them
                                        over
                                        the
                                        months. They also could be relied upon to use our systems and processes
                                        effectively.

                                        They worked consistently until the project was completed and showed initiative
                                        by
                                        researching
                                        solutions and making suggestions.
