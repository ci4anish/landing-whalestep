                                    Even though we live in the 21st century, service providers and customers are still
                                    looking for each other through acquaintances or specialized exhibitions, especially
                                    in
                                    the Hardscaping field. The main requirement was to create a platform where they can
                                    do
                                    this without leaving home and concentrate on the more important stuff in life.
                                    In brief, we divided UX flow into three parts - users post projects, contractors
                                    review
                                    them and give estimates, admin moderates the process. The end goal of these actions
                                    is a
                                    Contract with payments through milestones. Monetization is a percentage of all money
                                    that went through the application. Easy to say hard to do, but we‚Äôre not afraid of

                                    Our client, one of Australia‚Äôs most sought after negotiating coaches, addressed us
                                    with a problem. He needed a more flexible software solution that would allow
                                    creating very custom questionnaires/assessments for his students.
                                    During investigation faze together we came up with 6 question types with own UI,
                                    that can be mixed up to create an ideal questionnaire. Besides that, we created
                                    functionality for users to pass them, linking for companies and employees, a way to
                                    store previously created questionnaires and split them into groups, email automation
                                    with custom templates.

                                        The most important part was the creation of a reporting
                                        generation module with advanced filters for quick search through courses,
                                        companies,
                                        students, locations, dates, etc. As a result, we received students‚Äô data in
                                        visualization charts and their exports to excel and pdf files for the company‚Äôs
                                        management.

                                        When our client represented this system to the decision-makers of their clients‚Äô
                                        companies, they received a lot of positive feedbacks. Also, as he told us
                                        afterward,
                                        his work became easier and less time-consuming. As for us, we‚Äôre happy that we
                                        made
                                        one more contribution to someone‚Äôs life with hard work and good coding.

                                I‚Äôve met Larry at Web summit in Lisbon. He is the owner of an email marketing platform
                                for the enterprise. In a couple of months, he contacted me about complete app redesign
                                because their competitors are coming on their heels and they lost two big clients
                                because of that. After a month of estimations, discussions we came up with a set of
                                requirements and designs.

                                First of all, old UI wasn‚Äôt good for refactor, so we decided that it‚Äôs cheaper to made
                                new one from scratch. React framework was picked as basis as it was the best fit for the
                                project for several reasons: fast development, great performance, possibility to reuse
                                some of the components later on React Native mobile apps. Also, styling supports tablets
                                and mobile views as it was crucial for the client. Through Agile process we got such a
                                good work speed acceleration that we‚Äôre able to finish all of the refactorings in three
                                months <i>üî•</i>

                                    Now the application UI is blazing fast works without constant page reloading. After
                                    a big demo to enterprise clients, new UI got positive feedbacks and currently is
                                    introduced in the organizations by incremental steps. Larry was very pleased with
                                    the result and told that they started negotiations with the lost clients about the
                                    possibility of using their app again.

                                Ben was a programmer and employee of Adobe company. His experience and entrepreneurial
                                spirit made him the owner of one of the most popular photo editors in Australia. In 5
                                years of work more than 100k users used his software. The only problem was that in the
                                2020 year Google Chrome and other browsers officially stopped support Flash.

                                convenience, so he needed to find a way to solve the problem and found us.
                                At that time we didn‚Äôt have enough experience in graphics. Later, when I asked Ben
                                why he picked us for the implementation, he replied that he had a good feeling about
                                us :wink:. So, with good team spirit, more than one year of hard work, love with
                                JavaScript technologies stack and help of his team of graphics experts we made it.

                                    The application is functional and fast because all the photo filters and overlays
                                    were written on WebGL renderer that uses video card for math calculations. The app
                                    has advanced undo/redo system and supports a diverse set of features to edit photos,

                                    Currently, by his statistics, more than 60% of app users apply web version instead
                                    of the desktop one and report that they really like the UI. Well, we hope that the
                                    application will have a bright future and wish Ben the best of success!

                                Sadly or not, we are living in times when one person can‚Äôt make a big impact any longer.
                                That‚Äôs why management became so relevant, and new concepts and tools are constantly
                                getting introduced to the market. One of such concepts is the OKR framework originally
                                introduced by Intel and adopted by Google and many other companies. Our client‚Äôs goal
                                was to create the software suitable for middle and small businesses so that they also
                                could use OKR‚Äôs approach for planning and get all of the averages.

                                calculation of metrics based on them, gathering statistics and data visualization. For
                                ease of sharing statistics, we wrote exports in PDF. Components are connected and
                                support real-time recalculation and update. Data is represented for the users in
                                different kinds dependent on features: all kinds of custom charts, hierarchy view, tree
                                view, timeline, calendar and more. The design was created by our designer based on the

                                up with the idea of automatic visualizations building in PowerPoint reports. A lot of

                                information and it hurts. So they did basic MVP for their idea and managed to found the
                                investors. The next step was to create a fully functional application and that‚Äôs when we

                                your platform. Trovit takes advantage of such agreements.
                                We wrote a simple UI for search queries by location. On the backend, we‚Äôve integrated
                                with more than thirty open real estate dealers APIs to have coverage for 46 countries
                                throughout the world. People aren‚Äôt very patient these days, so it was very important to
