                                    Even though we live in the 21st century, service providers and customers are still
                                    looking for each other through acquaintances or specialized exhibitions, especially
                                    in
                                    the Hardscaping field. The main requirement was to create a platform where they can
                                    do
                                    this without leaving home and concentrate on the more important stuff in life.
                                    In brief, we divided UX flow into three parts - users post projects, contractors
                                    review
                                    them and give estimates, admin moderates the process. The end goal of these actions
                                    is a
                                    Contract with payments through milestones. Monetization is a percentage of all money
                                    that went through the application. Easy to say hard to do, but we’re not afraid of

                                    new ones that make online contracting better(as Pinterest like “Idea board” where
                                    you can dive into fresh ideas of how to make your yard perfect).

                                    Whale Step is a team of bright, driven young developers. They worked well on
                                    my
                                    product as
                                    co-developers to my existing team and showed improvements in their
                                    communication
                                    with them
                                    over
                                    the
                                    months. They also could be relied upon to use our systems and processes
                                    effectively.

                                    They worked consistently until the project was completed and showed
                                    initiative
                                    by
                                    researching
                                    solutions and making suggestions.

                                    As it is, for now, they delivered quality code which will soon go live. The
                                    whole team

                                    on
                                    the next

                                    They were able to jump right into our project and help take the lead of the
                                    front end.
                                    Taras, the team lead, was great with communication and did proper research
                                    on
