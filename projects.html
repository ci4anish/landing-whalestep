                                    Whale Step is a team of bright, driven young developers. They worked well on
                                    my
                                    product as
                                    co-developers to my existing team and showed improvements in their
                                    communication
                                    with them
                                    over
                                    the
                                    months. They also could be relied upon to use our systems and processes
                                    effectively.

                                    They worked consistently until the project was completed and showed
                                    initiative
                                    by
                                    researching
                                    solutions and making suggestions.

                                    As it is, for now, they delivered quality code which will soon go live. The
                                    whole team
                                    wishes

                                    on
                                    the next

                                    They were able to jump right into our project and help take the lead of the
                                    front end.
                                    Taras, the team lead, was great with communication and did proper research
                                    on
